# Carrot Ginger Soup

This is an incredibly easy to make soup that is pretty darn tasty. It can be totally vegan, or made with a bunch of butter and cream to provide an extra cream texture. My girlfriend is mostly vegan, so I make the vegan version.

I add curry powder to add a new dimension to the flavor.

This takes maybe 45 minutes to make, but will vary depending on your prep speed. I also use an immersion blender, which cuts down the time quite a bit.

## Ingredients

* A bunch of carrots (1.5ish pounds). Use orange carrots for color.
* One stick of celery
* 2-3 cloves of garlic
* Ginger root, enough for 3-4 Tbsp of grated ginger
* One large white onion
* 1 Tbsp white pepper
* 1.5 Tbsp curry powder
* Unsalted butter, or some higher temperature oil (grapeseed, avocado, etc.)
* 3-4 cups vegetable broth
* 1-1.5 cups coconut milk (use cream for a non-vegan creamy soup)

## Make It

* Add butter/oil to a dutch oven and heat to medium/medium-high heat.
* Chop the onion and celery.
* Add onion and cook until soft, adding celery about halfway through.
* Chop garlic and grate ginger. (You can push both through a garlic press as well.)
* Add garlic. Add more butter/oil when needed. Cook until fragrant (one minuteish).
* Add ginger. Cook for half a minute.
* Add 1/4 of vegetable broth. (The carrot will cook and soften faster in steam than in water.)
* While broth warms, chop the carrots.
* Add carrots, pepper, and curry powder. Cover. Cook on medium-high heat, stirring every few minutes. Cook for 25-30 minutes.
* Add broth. Add coconut milk/cream. Add more or less broth and coconut milk/cream to desired thickness. Continue to cook but do not boil.
* Blend. This is easy with an immersion blender.
* Reduce to simmer and stir. Serve.
