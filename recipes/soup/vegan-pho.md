# Vegan (and Gluten Free) Pho

There are several parts to a proper pho:

* The broth. I roast onions and herbs in the oven, use a vegetable broth base, add some red pepper flakes, cook it, and strain it.
* The noodles. If you're going gluten-free, you can use a fine rice vermicelli or any assortment of rice noodles. I'm using rice noodles and a thick wheat noodle that I infuse with beet juice to add some color.
* The content. I'm doing a vegan version, so I'm using shiitake mushrooms. (I can get one pound of shiitake at my local Asian market for $4.)
* The garnish. All the greens, herbs, peppers, and so on that you're used to when you have pho. I don't use bean sprouts.

This recipe aims to make about one gallon of broth. You can make your noodles and content, and prepare your garnish, as needed.

## Ingredients

* 4 3-inch cinnamon sticks
* 6 whole cloves
* 4 star anise
* 2 large white onions, peeled and halved
* 2 4-inch pieces of fresh ginger, not peeled, halved lengthwise
* 64oz vegetable broth (I swear by Better Than Bouillon's seasoned vegetable base.)
* 64oz water (I use a local spring water.)
* 4 tablespoons tamari
* 12 ounces (two large handfulls) rice noodles
* 1 can slices beets
* 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
* 10 ounces thinly sliced shiitake mushrooms
* Salt

For garnish

* Fresh basil
* Fresh mint
* Sliced green onions
* Sliced green jalepenos
* Wedges of lime

## Directions

* Peel and half the onions. Clean and half lengthwise the ginger. Placing cut-sides down, place onto a baking sheet and roast for 15 minutes at 500 degrees Fahrenheit.
* Toast cinnamon sticks, cloves, and star anise in a dutch oven over medium heat for 3-4 minutes.
* Add onion, ginger, vegetable stock, water, and tamari. Bring to boil, then reduce to simmer. Simmer for 30 minutes.
* While broth is simmering, cook noodles according to directions. If using beet juice to color noodles, puree beets and sautee, placing noodles in beet puree with two minutes of 
noodle cook time remaining. Strain noodles and set aside.
* Warm light olive oil in skillet until shimmering. Add sliced shiitake mushrooms and salt. Sautee until soft and brown.
* After broth is finished, strain. Season with extra tamari and salt as needed.
* Serve broth, noodles, mushrooms, and garnish.
