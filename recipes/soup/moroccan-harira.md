# Moroccan Harira Soup

* vegan
* gluten-free

I had this as an appetizer nearly everywhere I went in Morocco. It can be made in many ways, and I
was not able to find anything online that accurately represented what I consistently had all over
Morocco. So, I took several recipes and modified them, making a vegan and gluten-free version.

## Ingredients

* 1 onion, finely chopped
* 1 stick celery, finely chopped
* 3 tomatoes, peeled and pureed (I use a food mill)
* 3 Tsp tomato paste
* 1 can (15 oz) chick peas
* 1/2 cup green lentils
* 1/2 cup rice noodles chopped (or vermicelli -- has gluten)
* 1/3 cup finely chopped cilantro
* 1/3 cup finely chopped parsely
* 2 cloves garlic
* 1 Tsp lemon juice
* olive oil
* 1/3 cup flour
* 2.5 liters water
* 3 tsp salt
* 1 tsp ground tumeric
* 1 tsp cumin
* 1 tsp ground cinnamon
* 1/2 tsp ground ginger
* 1/4 tsp ground cayenne pepper

## Prep

* Soak the lentils in water for one hour and then drain.

## Directions

* On medium heat, sautee onions and celery with olive oil.
* When starting to soften, add tumeric, cumin, cinnamon, ginger, and cayenne pepper. Stir. Use more olive oil as needed.
* When starting to brown, add garlic.
* After garlic has sauteed for < 1 minute, add:
..* tomato puree
..* parsely
..* cilantro
..* lentils
..* salt
..* lemon juice
..* water
* Stir, cover, and cook on medium for 45 minutes, stirring occasionally.
* Add the chick peas and tomato paste.
* Dilute the flour in water, whisk, and slowly add to soup.
* Add rice noodles.
* Cover and cook for 10 minutes.
