# Moroccan Tagine of Tomato, Bell Pepper, Sweet Potato, Chickpeas, and Eggs.

Makes 4 adult servings. Takes 2-4 hours.

I use a Moroccan tagine with a heat diffuser on the stovetop to cook this dish, but it could also be done in a Dutch oven.

Sometimes I add different incredients, such as shallots or pearl onions, or leave out the preserved lemons.

## Ingredients

* 1 15-16oz can garbonzo beans (chickpeas) rinsed and drained
* 1 small can of tomato paste
* 1 medium size can of tomato sauce
* 1 cup vegetable broth
* 2-3 medium sweet potatoes
* 2 small white onions finely chopped
* 1-2 stalks celery finely chopped
* 3-4 garlic cloves finely chopped/pressed
* 2-3 small carrots finely chopped
* 2-3 bell peppers
* 1 preserved lemon
* 4 fresh eggs
* Moroccan or Tunisian harissa, or something close such as sambal oelek
* small bunch of cilantro finely chopped
* small bunch of parsely finely chopped
* small bunch of mint finely chopped
* 2 tsp ground turmeric
* 2 tsp coriander
* 1 tsp cardamom
* 3 tsp cumin
* 1 tsp ground cinnamon
* 1 tsp cayenne pepper
* 2 tsp ground ginger
* 1 Tsp dark honey
* olives, whole or chopped, pitted or not, your choice
* olive or avocado oil (I buy the avocado oil at Costco and love it as a high temp oil)

## Directions

* Heat the tagine/dutch oven with oil to medium-high heat. Keep the top on to warm it.

* Add the onions and cook until translucent. You'll need the next steps ready because they proceed rapidly.

* Add the carrots and celery with more oil. Cook for 2-3 minutes.

* Add the harissa, turmeric, coriander, cardamom, cumin, cinnamon, cayenne pepper. Mix well and heat for one more minute.

* Add garlic and ginger. Cook for 1 minute.

* Add vegetable broth.

* Add tomato paste and tomato sauce.

* Add half of cilantro, half of parsely, and all of mint. Stir. Cover while not stirring to maintain moisture.

* Add honey and stir.

* Slice preserved lemon into eighths and add to tagine.

* Slice sweet potato in 1/2-inch cubes. Stir tagine and add sweet potato cubes on top. Cover. Steam will cook the sweet potatos. Stir after 15 minutes or so.

* Slice into strips and blacken bell peppers in a separate pan. Set to the side.

* Cover/uncover to control moisture level. The sauce should thicken and be slightly runny. Uncover to thicken more.

* When sweet potatos are 3/4 done, add the chickpeas and stir. Cook for 5-10 minutes.

* Stir. Dig holes for the eggs. Crack the eggs into the tagine. Cover and cook for 5 minutes.

* Add the olives.

* Add the cooked bell peppers.

* Sprinkle the remaining cilantro, parsely, and mint on top.

* When eggs, chickpeas, and sweet potatos are near done, remove from heat.

* Serve over couscous or eat as-is.
