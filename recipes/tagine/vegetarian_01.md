# Moroccan Tagine of Tomato, Bell Pepper, Sweet Potato, Chickpeas, and Eggs.

Makes 4 adult servings.

I use a Moroccan tagine with a heat diffuser on the stovetop to cook this dish, but it could also be done in a Dutch oven, either on the stove or in the oven.

I also make a variant of this that is known in Morocco as "tagine kefta," a tomato based lamb meatball tagine.

Sometimes I add different incredients, such as shallots or pearl onions, or leave out the preserved lemons.

## Ingredients

* 1 15-16oz can garbonzo beans (chickpeas) rinsed and drained
* 1 small can of tomato paste
* 1 medium size can of tomato sauce
* 1 cup vegetable broth
* 1 large sweet potato
* 2 small onions finely chopped
* 1 stalk celery finely chopped
* 3-4 garlic cloves finely chopped/pressed
* 2-3 small carrots finely chopped
* 2-3 bell peppers (I use one yellow, orange, and red, and use half of each)
* 1 preserved lemon
* 4 fresh eggs
* Moroccan or Tunisian harissa, or something close such as sambal oelek
* small bunch of cilantro finely chopped
* small bunch of parsely finely chopped
* small bunch of mint finely chopped
* 2 tsp ground tumeric
* 2 tsp coriander
* 1 tsp cardamom
* 3 tsp cumin
* 1 tsp ground cinnamon
* 1 tsp cayenne pepper
* 2 tsp ground ginger
* 1 Tsp dark honey
* olives, whole or chopped, pitted or not
* olive oil

## Directions

* Heat the tagine/dutch oven with olive oil to medium heat.
* Add the onions and cook until slightly soft.
* Add the carrots and celery, and more olive oil. Cook until onions are translucent.
* Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute.
* Add the harissa, tumeric, coriander, cardamom, cumin, cinnamon, cayenne pepper, ginger, and honey. Mix well and heat for one more minute.
* Add the tomato sauce. Stir and bring up to medium heat.
* Add half of cilantro, half of parsely, and half of mint. Stir. Cover while not stirring to maintain moisture.
* Heat vegetable broth and stir in tomato paste. Add to tagine. Stir and cover.
* Slice preserved lemon into eighths and add to tagine.
* Slice sweet potato in 1/2-inch cubes. Stir tagine and add sweet potato cubes on top. Cover. Steam will cook the sweet potatos. Stir after 15 minutes or so.
* Slice into strips and blacken bell peppers in a separate pan. Set to the side.
* Cover/uncover to control moisture level. The sauce should thicken and be slightly runny, but not liquid.
* When sweet potatos are 3/4 done, add the chickpeas and stir. Cook for 5-10 minutes.
* Stir. Dig holes for the eggs. Crack the eggs into the tagine. Cover and cook for 5 minutes.
* Add the olives.
* Add the cooked bell peppers.
* Sprinkle the remaining cilantro, parsely, and mint on top.
* When eggs, chickpeas, and sweet potatos are near done, remove from heat.
* Serve over couscous or eat as-is.
