## Introduction

We received something like this in a food subscription box and we really liked it. I found a few recipes online, but none
of them had the acid/citrus flavor I was looking for. So, I made this. I definitely think the lemon makes this.

It can be used as a dressing, a dipping sauce, and so on. We dip falafel in it, drizzle it over maple glazed carrots, and
use it as a salad dressing on massaged kale salads.

## Ingredients

* 1/2 cup tahini
* 2 lemons (maybe more, to taste) juiced over a strainer. Or, lemon juice to taste.
* 2 Tbsp white miso paste
* 2 Tbsp maple syrup
* 2 Tbsp soy sauce
* 2-8 Tbsp water (you can always add more as needed depending on the application)

## Directions

Whisk, adding more lemon and water as needed
