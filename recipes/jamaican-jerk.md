# Jamaican Jerk Tempeh

I make this in about ten minutes using an immersion blender and a single pan.

## The Process

This is just the order I do this in. I make this about once per week, so I can just write down what I do. It makes enough for a single slab of tempeh.

* Place the tempeh unwrapped in a pan of near boiling water. Cook on either side for 2-3 minutes. While tempeh is cooking, make the sauce.
* Add soy sauce, salt, pepper, 1 part nutmeg, 2 parts cinnamon, 2 parts thyme, 2 parts brown sugar, and 3 parts ground allspice, and one chopped garlic clove to a coffee cup.
* Roughly chop 1/2 a red/orange/yellow bell peppar, or 3 small sweet peppers. Add to the coffee cup. Blend using an immersion blender.
* You should end up with roughly 1/2 cup or slightly more sauce. It should be liquid. It will reduce quickly.
* Dry the tempeh and cut into cups. Clean the pan. Heat the pan over medium-high heat.
* Add tempeh back to pan. Add sauce (all of it) to pan.
* Stir frequently until sauce is reduced and tempeh is slightly charred. The sauce will thicken against the tempeh.
