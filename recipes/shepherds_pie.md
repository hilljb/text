# Shepherd's Pie

This is a combination of several recipes I've found online, including [Gordon Ramsay's recipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_GNznvIN1E) and [Food Wishes' recipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsrTU3CJn2c).

I've made this as a 2-person meal. It worked pretty well in a small to medium casserole dish. You can scale as needed.

## Ingredients

1 pound of ground lamb (Shepherd's pie uses lamb, not beef)
1/2 onion
2 carrots (or equivalent carrots and peas)
3 gold potatoes (or 2 gold and 1 russet)
1/2 stick of unsalted butter
15g flour
1/2 small can of tomato paste
50g cream cheese
1 egg
2-3 Tbsp Worchestershire sauce
1/2 glass of red wine
1/2 small block of Irish cheddar
1 large Tbsp Better than Bouillon (beef or chicken)
salt and pepper
1 tsp rosemary, preferably fresh
1 tsp thyme, preferably fresh
1 tsp paprika
1/2 tsp cinnamon
1/2 tsp cayenne (it does more than make things spicy)
1 small bunch green onions
olive oil

## Make the Mince

* Finely chop the 1/2 onion.
* Heat olive oil with 1 Tbsp butter at medium in a dutch oven. When warm, add onion and ground lamb. Cook until browned and liquid has evaporated. (10 minutes)
* Add salt and pepper, rosemary, thyme, paprika, cinnamon, tomato paste, and half (1/4 tsp) cayenne. Stir.
* Add flour and stir. This will thicken the mince like a roux. Don't burn the flour.
* Add red wine. Stir. Allow the wine to evaporate.
* Add worchestershire sauce. Stir.
* Add stock (Better than Bouillon + water). Stir. The mince will thicken over a few minutes.
* Add carrots. Stir.
* Move to low/medium heat. Allow to reduce further if needed. Once a proper consistency is reached, move to low heat and cover. Work on the potatoes.

## Make the Potatoes

Good mashed potatoes are definitely an art form. There are tons of videos on YouTube about how to do them correctly and everyone has their own spin on things. This is just how I do mine for this specific recipe.

* Peel and chop potatoes into same size chunks.
* Place cold water into a pot with a good amount of salt. Add potatoes and then turn on heat. Bring to a boil and reduce heat to medium. Cook potatoes until they are soft. You should be able to press a knife or fork into the potatoes easily. 
* Drain potatoes and place back into pot on low heat.
* Add the remaining butter, cayenne (1/4 tsp), salt, pepper, cream cheese, cheddar, and chopped green onions.
* Mash the mixture with a masher or fork. (If you want fluffier potatoes, you can use a food mill to rice the potatoes before placing back into the pot and adding the other ingredients. Food mills make the best mashed potatoes IMO.)
* Crack the egg, discard the egg white, and beat the yolk. Add the yolk to the potato mix and stir.

## Make the Pie

* Add the mince to a casserole dish. Flatten with a spoon.
* Add potatoes to the top of the mince. It's easiest to add lots of smaller lumps of potatoes and smooth them out later, as you don't want to disturb the mince or mix the mince with the potatoes. At this stage, most cooks will use a fork to create more surface area on the top of the potatoes in a hatch pattern. This isn't just for looks, as the extra surface area creates more room for the top to brown and crisp. The cheese that was added will help this process. Some cooks will also add more cheese to the top, either Irish cheddar or parmesan.
* Preheat an oven to 375F (190C).
* Place the dish in the oven and bake. This may take 20-30 minutes, or more, based on the size of the pie.
* Optionally, you can use the broiler to brown the top of the potatoes at the end of baking.
* Remove from oven. Let sit for 10-15 minutes. Serve.
