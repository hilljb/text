# Kadai Gravy

Kadai seems to come in a few forms, mainly in a dry form where it is more-or-less
clumped onto things (e.g., chicken, mushrooms, whatever) and also in a gravy form
where it is used like a makhani. I had a gravy kadai in Mumbai that was great,
and this recipe is my attempt to recreate it.

## Ingredients

1 cup veggie broth
2 red onions
Roughly 30oz tomato puree
1 green bell pepper
2 jalapenos
5-6 garlic cloves
2 inches ginger, grated
3-4 dried chilies
1/2 cup coconum cream
1 Tbsp coriander
2 tsp cumin
1 tsp fennel seeds
2 tsp red chili powder
1/2 tsp garam masala
1/2 tsp turmeric
2 tsp salt
1/2 cup chopped cilantro

## Directions

Finely chop onion, cook in oil, add oil soluble spices, add garlic until fragrant, add broth, add rest except coconut
